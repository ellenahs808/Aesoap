# Summary

This project is a clone of aesop.com, a high quality and minimalistic ecommerce website. The application is written using React/Redux in the frontend, and Ruby on Rails in the backend with PostgreSQL. It currently has user auth and products display functionality.


# Key Features

## Products

Products are grouped by category for better user experience.

The products table was created to include multiple display features. Users are able to view the product index or a single product.




## Moving Forward
* Implementing a cart feature to be able to add, update or delete items in a cart.
* Implementing a search feature to be able to search specific products.
* Implementing recent orders history from a user's account.
